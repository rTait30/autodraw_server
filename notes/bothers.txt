styling uses lots of non tailwind inline generated by gpt

form is overly complex the formbase thing might be a good idea but in any case needs to be way simplified

putting schemas in the db is complex

the whole thing needs to be api first. that part should be made properly before others

all the pdf/dxf generation code is wayyyy overly complex and should be abstracted away maybe multiple times
