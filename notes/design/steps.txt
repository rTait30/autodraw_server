Step 1 Skin (mpanel):

	Create wireframe, confirm mesurments are valid (meausre tool)
	SW Isometric
	Circles on plane at UCS (use Iso) at tension detail specified by cutomer
	redesign parimeter edge accounting for tension detail (make sure top of post)
	Uncheck straighten joined edges
	cable tension Ratio 2.4
	Identify planes, mpanel polylines, create mpanel skin (if ridges make bottom line ridge)

	cable relax

	(ridge)
	right click relax
	Check straighten joined edges
	Cable tension Ratio 2.4
	extended data, get mesh data, set Weft/Warp to 6, Cable tension bottom to 0.2
	select outside edges and meshes, relax

	(join)
	draw line between close corners
	draw line between center point of corner lines
	draw line from center point of the to perpendicular to sail
	circle ucs midpoint
	drag node to circle intersection
	select mesh and outer edges
	relax

Step 2 2D Pattern (mpanel):

	create 2d pattern (panel mesh)
			
Step 3 (mpanel objects):
	
	remake circles trim for arc
	align corner detail bisecting corners to circle arc
	delete arcs
	delete detail lines
	draw cable lines
	delete skin
	create polyline
	calculate cable distance (model distance + 1m if sail track, + 2m if all cable)

Step 4 (autocad only):

	check Z
	Draw circle (500 radius)
	Scale based on project details (0.965 - 0.995)
	Draw large circle around whole project

Step 5:

	Create offset lines out by pocket size (20,80), sailtrask (40,40)

	Delete outer arcs

	cut edges
	
	(sailtrack)
	create circles at edge (50 default)
	draw line from intersection of circle and cable line on track edge and fold line 2 perpendicular to fold 2
	increase circles radius (120 default)
	drawline from intersection of circle and cable edge (other side) cable side to fold line 2 perpendicular to fold line
	create 50 offset line inner (other side)
	extend other side line to 50 line.
	fillet lines on each side (30 radius default)
	trim outside lines
	draw line from top left track corner cut edge to fold 1
	make array along sailtrack edge increment by scale amount, explode
	delete work line



	(exit point)
	draw circle 50 radius from rear of prorig
	extend prorig line
	draw circle with radius 100 at intersection of prorig line and circle
	draw line from intersection of cable line and 100 circle to work line perpindicular to work line
	draw line from extended prorig line to point on cable line and 100 circle
	trim all lines over work line
	fillet new edge

	(O ring)
	offset outer 
	draw circle (default 100) from out
	draw line from intersection of circle and cable line to work line perpindicular to work line	
	copy cable line to tangent of 50 circle



	label corners (20 height) and EX inside fold

	delete cable line

Step 6:

	determine seam direction
	align horizontally
	create cut length offsets, 35 mm from those
	


	

Step 7:

	(if seems)
	seperate panels
	delete internal line
	draw new internal offset 10mm from cut line
	draw points on top panel left side intersection between fold line and inner offest
	draw point on same x posiiton as point on bottom panel on inner offset
	array points with gaps of 600mm
	draw cut points,explode, delete extra points
	label cuts
	

Step 8:

	delete fold 1
	Group
	
Step 9:
	
	Copy
	Draw boundaries to fabric
	Nest panels

	Add any extras

Step 10:

	if topside copy, if underside mirror.
	put shapes on aprpropriate layers

	clean up arcs
	
	
Step 11:

	
	Label corners
	Label details
	Label dimensions
	exit, logo

	cable length (round to 10)

	(sailtrack)
	multileader "kedar"
	
	black

Topview:

	pan to drawing detail (top)
	pan to specific detail (bottom)
	turn off viewport layer
