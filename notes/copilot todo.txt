Phase 1: High-Impact Functional Fixes
These changes address the most critical bugs and improve the core functionality.

1. Fix Transformation and Drawing Issues
Goal: Ensure that all steps are drawn in their correct virtual spaces without overlapping or misalignment.
Steps:
Refactor the drawStep method in CanvasManager to consistently reset transformations and apply offsets.
Centralize scaling and offset calculations in CanvasManager and pass them to steps.
Test each step individually to ensure proper alignment and scaling.
2. Clean Up Unused Code
Goal: Remove unused variables, commented-out code, and debugging artifacts to make the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain.
Steps:
Go through each file (e.g., twoExtra.js, threeNest.js) and remove unused variables and commented-out code.
Remove unnecessary console.log statements.
3. Add Error Handling
Goal: Handle errors gracefully, especially for async operations like server requests in threeNest.js.
Steps:
Wrap async operations in try-catch blocks.
Display error messages on the canvas or in the UI when something goes wrong.
Validate input data before processing it in steps.
Phase 2: Code Maintainability Improvements
These changes make the codebase easier to understand, extend, and debug.

4. Centralize Common Logic
Goal: Reduce code duplication by extracting reusable logic into utility functions.
Steps:
Create a canvasUtils.js file for common canvas operations (e.g., scaling, drawing rectangles, resetting transformations).
Refactor steps to use these utility functions instead of duplicating logic.
5. Simplify CanvasManager
Goal: Let CanvasManager focus on managing the canvas and delegate drawing to steps.
Steps:
Move data processing logic (e.g., splitPanelIfNeeded) to a separate utility module.
Pass pre-calculated scaling and offsets to steps instead of recalculating them in each step.
6. Modularize Step Logic
Goal: Make step files more modular and reusable.
Steps:
Group related logic (e.g., splitPanelIfNeeded, createPanelObject) into a shared module for surgical covers.
Ensure each step file focuses only on its specific task (e.g., drawing and updating data).
Phase 3: User Experience Enhancements
These changes improve the UI/UX and make the application more user-friendly.

7. Improve UI Feedback
Goal: Provide better feedback to users for errors and updates.
Steps:
Add error messages or visual indicators (e.g., red borders) for invalid inputs.
Display loading indicators for async steps (e.g., threeNest.js).
Show success messages when configurations are saved.
8. Make the Layout Responsive
Goal: Ensure the UI works well on different screen sizes.
Steps:
Use CSS media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screens.
Test the layout on different devices and browsers.
Phase 4: Performance and Testing
These changes ensure the application runs efficiently and is robust.

9. Optimize Scaling and Layout Calculations
Goal: Avoid recalculating scaling and offsets unnecessarily.
Steps:
Calculate scaling and offsets once in CanvasManager and reuse them across steps.
Cache results where possible to avoid redundant calculations.
10. Add Unit Tests
Goal: Ensure critical functions work as expected and prevent regressions.
Steps:
Write unit tests for utility functions (e.g., splitPanelIfNeeded, calculateScale).
Mock the canvas context to test drawing functions.
Test async operations (e.g., server requests in threeNest.js) with mocked responses.
Proposed Timeline
Week 1: Focus on Phase 1 (fixing bugs and cleaning up unused code).
Week 2: Implement Phase 2 (refactoring for maintainability).
Week 3: Work on Phase 3 (UI/UX improvements).
Week 4: Complete Phase 4 (performance optimization and testing).
Immediate Next Steps
Refactor drawStep in CanvasManager to fix transformation and drawing issues.
Remove unused code and debugging artifacts from all files.
Add error handling for async operations in threeNest.js.
